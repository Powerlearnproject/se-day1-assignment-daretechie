Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
The process of designing, developing, and maintaining software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**Answer:** 
Innovation of Programming languages both low-level like C and high-level like Python

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Answer:** 
1. *Requirement:* Gathering of user system requirements.
2. *Design:* Design the system architecture and interface based on the user requirement.
3. *Implementation:* Writing code and building the system based on the design
4. *Testing:* Testing of various parts of the software is necessary to ensure quality standards.
5. *Deployment:* Releasing the software to the user
6. *Maintenance:* Updating and supporting the system after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**Answer:**
Waterfall is an approach where a phase of a project is completed before the next begins. E.g Construction like the building of the bridge, developing hardware products
Agile is an approach where the project is iterative and flexible. E.g. Software development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Answer:**
*Software Developer:* They handle the writing of code for software
*Quality Assurance Eng.:* They handle software testing to meet standards.
*Project Manager:* They plan, execute and deliver the software


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Answer:**
*Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):* software used in writing, debugging and testing code. e.g Visual studio code, Pycharm etc.
*Version Control Systems:* it is a way to track and coordinate source code of a software. It is also a software like git etc


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

**Answer:**
Challenges are Changing Requirements, Tight Deadlines, Technical Debt. 
Ways to overcome these challenges are Communication, adopting Agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

**Answer:**
*Unit Testing:* it involve testing of a component part of a software.
*Integration Testing:* It involves testing of interactions between different components
*System Testing:* It is testing of the whole system.
*Acceptance Testing:* this testing ensures the software meets user requirements.

Testing ensures specified quality standards of software.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Answer:**
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with AI models, particularly large language models like GPT.
It helps us to ask clear prompts from the AI model.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Answer:**
*Vague:* Tell me about technology.
*Improve:* Describe the impact of artificial intelligence on job automation in the manufacturing industry over the last decade.

The improved prompt is more specific, provides context and clearly mentioned the objective.
